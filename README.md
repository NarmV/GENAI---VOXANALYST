🧠 VoxAnalyst: AI-Powered Psychiatric Support Agent
VoxAnalyst is a GenAI-based mental health assistant designed to offer supportive, non-clinical psychiatric guidance using advanced language models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project was developed as part of a GenAI Capstone initiative, with a mission to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and mental wellness.

💡 Project Objective
To build an AI Psychiatry Agent that can:

Respond to mental health-related queries empathetically.

Use domain-specific knowledge for improved response quality.

Support users with helpful, human-like conversational experiences.

Demonstrate real-time or batch response generation using RAG pipelines.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Google Colab

ChromaDB – for vector storage and retrieval

Google GenAI (Gemini) – for language generation

LangChain – RAG orchestration

Streamlit (optional for UI prototype)

🔍 Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance factual accuracy.

Context-aware responses for mental health-related questions.

Modular architecture for easy extension or fine-tuning.

Integration with a knowledge base specific to psychiatry/psychology.
